    <h1>HTML Essential Training</h1>
    <h2>Formatting page content</h2>
    <p>In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</p>
    
        <h3>Adding headings</h3>
        <p>Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy of the content. 
    You can use heading values ranging from a top-level heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. 
    While there are several competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, 
    what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent  manner, 
    to accurately reflect the importance of your content. 
    It's also important to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, 
    so deciding on when and how to use headings is an important part of planning your site.</p>
    
        <h3>Using paragraphs</h3>
        <p> The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags, 
    and one that you'll use often. It indicates a paragraph of text, 
    and should be used for each individual paragraph.</p>
    
        <h3>Line breaks</h3>
        <p>Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, 
    create a new line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, 
    you use the line break tag (&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, 
    meaning you can use them within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag.</p> 
        <p>Let's say you were formatting an address, for example. 
    You could use line breaks to make sure each line of the address appeared on a separate line, 
    but still remained within the same paragraph.</p>

        <h3>Displaying special characters</h3>
        <p>Certain characters are reserved for HTML, meaning you cannot use them in regular content. Using a left angle bracket like this
            "&lang;" in your code can cause rendering issues in certain situations.
            To display an ampersand type in "&amp;". This can be extremely helpful when Displaying
            &copy; and &trade;
        </p>
        <p>You can find a very thorough list of named character entities on 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character
            _entity_references">Wikipedia.org</a>.

        <h3>Controlling white space</h3>
        <p>
            To use additional white space you must use the &amp;nbsp; entity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try it here. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add as much white space as you want here
        </p>
        <p>The primary purpose of the non-breaking space is to inform browsers when a line 
            break shouldn't occur during a string of text. For example, adding a non-breaking 
            space between Formula&nbsp;One would ensure that a line break never occurse and splits up
            the words.
        </p>
           <h3>Inserting images</h3>
        <p><img src="_images/lowcountry.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Lowcountry South Carolina">Images are placed on the page through the use of the <b>img</b> tag. Images are considered <b>replaced content</b>, that is the element is replaced with the asset it references. The image element has several important attributes. The <b>src</b> attribute is used to tell the browser where to find the image. The <b>alt</b> attribute allows you to pass along descriptive text representing the image. This can be used by screen readers, or displayed in the event the image fails to load.The <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> are optional and can be used to pass the dimensions of the image to the browser. If omitted, the browser will still display the image at its native width and height. These values can be changed to force the browser to size the image differently from it's native size.</p>
        <p>Most browser support a wide range of image types. For the most part, you're safe using jpg, png, gif, bmp, and svg image formats.</p>
        <p><img src="_images/sc_flag.png" width="400" height="400" alt="South Carolina flag">Insert a new image beside this text.</p>
